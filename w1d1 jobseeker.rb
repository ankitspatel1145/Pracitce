# In a 2 dimensional array grid, each value grid[i][j] represents the height of a building located there. We are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings, by any amount (the amounts can be different for different buildings). Height 0 is considered to be a building as well.

# At the end, the "skyline" when viewed from all four directions of the grid, i.e. top, bottom, left, and right, must be the same as the skyline of the original grid. A city's skyline is the outer contour of the rectangles formed by all the buildings when viewed from a distance. See the following example.

# What is the maximum total sum that the height of the buildings can be increased?

# Example
# Input: grid = [[3,0,8,4],[2,4,5,7],[9,2,6,3],[0,3,1,0]]
# Output: 35

# A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains. For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 == 0,and 128 % 8 == 0.

# Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

# Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self dividing number, including the bounds if possible.

# Part 1: Say that I gave you an array of length n, containing the numbers 1..n in jumbled order. "Sort" this array in O(n) time. You should be able to do this without looking at the input.

# Part 2: Say that I give you an array of length n with numbers in the range 1..N (N >= n). Sort this array in O(n + N) time. You may use O(N) memory.

# Part 3: Say I give you an array of n strings, each of length k. I claim that, using merge sort, you can sort this in O(knlog(n)), since comparing a pair of strings takes O(k) time.

# I want you to beat that. Sort the strings in O(kn). Hint: do not compare any two strings. You may assume all strings contain only lowercase letters a..z without whitespace or punctuation.
